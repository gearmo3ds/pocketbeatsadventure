Evoke 2024 demo for Nintendo 3DS

## Music
About the music: I did chop a 3 second loop from a track of the music producer Posij and re-shuffled the order.

Please check him out and buy his music [on Juno Download](https://www.junodownload.com/search/?facet%5Bmirror_artist_facetm%5D%5B%5D=posij) if you like.

All other samples are oneshots or classic breaks.

## Code

First, apologies for the messy structure, I was sweating crazy to even get the demo done in time as I explored what is even possible. Definitely not an example or good practice to go by. 

Since I am a demo-making noob, I re-used existing code from [The Demo Effects Collection](https://demo-effects.sourceforge.net/) from W.P. can Paasen.

Namely the plasma effect and the font image.

The original code used SDL but I made it output to a native 16bit framebuffer instead that is sent to the GPU.

Secondly, I copied and re-used a few files from [Raccoons ate my ticket](https://github.com/SVatG/RaccoonsAteMyTicket) from SVatG's Nordlicht invite demo of last year. In fact this demo is what made me decide to come to evoke and re-discover the demo scene that I had forgotten about for some 25 years. Check out my [old FT2 chiptunes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPHiHTr8zWc&t=994s) while you are at it.

Yes, copied the Tools/VectorLibrary and the soundtrack/[minivorbis](https://github.com/edubart/minivorbis) for playing the ogg file.

## Building

If you, like me, use linux and qtcreator then you are good to go.

Otherwise you'll have to manage on you own.


## The app

I saw negative comments about the demo being an add. 

So far you would sign up an pay 1 Euro to be able to install the app.

But I have decided to provide a special Evoke release for some limited time that is completely free so people can try it without signing into patreon.

That may take some psychological pressure of my conscience.


## The party

I was super stoked to meet some SVatG members on site: PoroCYon, RaccoonViolet and SagaMusix (maintainer of OpenMPT, didn't know that before :D ).

Thanks for your kindness!
